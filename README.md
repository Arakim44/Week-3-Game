### about
 
Playing hangman on paper with your friends is very easy, but on JavaScript, it was not so simple for me.
It was a lot of thought process of how to think like computers. 
I mainley used click event in order to listen for the letters that the players will click the buttons of alphabets. Number of Guesses remainings are displayed and letter you already guessed will turn into red after clicking and won't be able to click again anymore.

### Future?
In the future developing, I will definitely add images that is corresponding to the game as it progresses. I am just super proud myself making this simple hangman game that's playable. Yay.
